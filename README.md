### Little things to learn
- Todo components are separated so that when the time comes where you
have numerous components they are neatly organized in the components
folder. (src/components/todo)
- .map and key, these two will show different keys for objects inside
arrays in the console.
- onChange and updateText which lets you type in the search or
add todo bar.
